### 1. Create Dataset with perfectly known performance of the ml models:
* Binary-Classification, classes are 50:50: 
* Every model has a true predicting power of 50% accuracy
* Model score = True predicting power?

### 2. Investigate different methods of evaluating the model score
* Cross-Validation 
* Nested-Cross-validation
* Hold-out
* Further methods

### 3. Influence Factors:
* Dataset-size
* Amount of Features
* ML-Model (Decision-Tree, *Gradient Boosting Tree, SVM, NN*)
* Hyperparameter Optimization (Grid-Search, *Bayesian, Random*)
